# SE2

Turns out our EC2 needed some extra things running on it before we could,
run our backend code through it. So I am now looking into downloading all of
the necessary packages to the EC2 so we can run the code through it. 

The problem in using the connection from gitHub to EC2 is the, EC2 is looking
for an application to be connected and what we are trying to do is run individual
pieces of code through it. I have read that this is possible but am still working 
on making it happen.
