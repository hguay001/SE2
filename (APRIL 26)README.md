# SE2
Hayden's SE2 Documentation


I got all of the Github repos pushing to our EC2 instance and now I am beginning to work on transfering to SQL Server to
meet the requirements of changing a component in our project. This should be much easier due to the fact that I am much more
familiar with SQL Server and I can work my way around any mishaps a little easier. The EC2 is working as we wanted now and
it took time to configure but it was something I had never worked with before so it took some research and configuring.

The EC2 documentation upload on this git repo has some pdf's on how the EC2 was setup and how we connect to the instance via
SSH.
