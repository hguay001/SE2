Whenever I try to push backend code to the EC2 it says we have an,
"unhealthy instance" so I am beginning to try to figure out why the instance
is unhealthy so we can sync our code to the instance.

I've Tried:
- Downloading Code Deploy
- Updating the instance
- Creating a new instance
- Pushing other things besides our code
*All attempts still stated UNHEALTHY*
