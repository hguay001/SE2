# SE2

I started by creating an EC2 instance through the Amazon Web Services.
We decided to use an EC2 to serve as a backend server for our code.
Amazon allows you to create an instance for free, under certain circumstances, 
so I created an instance running ubuntu, with roommateappas the key pair, and 
a public privacy so we can all access it through the terminal and ssh.

The instance is causing me some trouble while attempting to take our code from
gitHub and linking it too the instance. It is stated that it is possible, but 
whenever I attempt to do it, our instance states that it's non-healthy.

I am continuing to fight with the instance to get our code to run through it,
and if successful the EC2 instance will update automatically as we add code and
serve as a server for such code.
