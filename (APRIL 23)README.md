This week, for me, was devoted to our applications logo. I had created some possible options prior to this week but we think it
is important to keep a logo simple and professional. I desided to keep the color scheme of the logo the same as the color scheme 
within the actual application. At first we had a house around the letters RM (Roommate Match/Roomies) but it was too conjested
in the small application space.

From this I decided to remove the house around the letters and just make the letters larger and more clear in the small logo
frame. I also added a drop shadow to make the app make it look like it is floating. I am now waiting for our customers feedback
on this new logo mockup. I personally think it is a bit plain but if the customer thinks it goes with the app we will head in
that direction, and keep the logo simple yet sophisticated.
