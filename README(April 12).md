# SE2
Hayden's SE2 Documentation

I finally got the EC2 working with our corresponding GitHub repo.
I had to clone the repo in the EC2 instance and also set an update so,
it fetches any new information added to that repo.

I also am working on uploading both sketches and 1st drafts of the application's
logo / icon.
